Cleaning
_____________
- real_Price: Real resale price that is adjusted for inflation using Singapore's monthly CPI of housing and utilities that were referenced to 2019. Formula is (resale_price / CPI) * 100. 
- remaining_lease was only available for 2016 onwards. 2016 remaining_lease were integers while 2017 onwards were in strings with years and months. Converted 2017 onwards to float years 
- flat_model is cleaned for duplicate classes, but should be further categorized/grouped to reduce number of classes.

Augmenting
_____________
- downloaded school, supermarket, hawkers, mrt, shopping malls, parks names/streets and got their coordinates. This was done through OneMap.sg. MRTs already has its coordinates from a link
- parks and supermarkets do not have names as parks data did not come with them, while for supermarkets, postal code was used
- computed distance to nearest amenities for each of the amenity
- computed number of each amenities within a 2km radius

Plots
_____________
- median was chosen to avoid outliers
- lollipop charts compared 1997 and 2019 as 1997 was year of Asian Financial Crisis and 2019 was the latest year as 2020 did not have complete year and is affected by covid
- lollipop charts also compared 2015 and 2019 as 2015 was around the year after cooling measures so there was a dip in prices. CHANGE TO 2014 INSTEAD!!!
- lollipop charts also looked at all room types and 4-room separately as 4-rooms has the highest frequency of resales
- ridge plot used only 3-room : executive as the other types of rooms (1,2-room,multigeneration) had very little cases in 2017:2019. This period was chosen as it is the past few years

TO DO
____________
- Check for duplicates
- Reduce number of classes in flat model
- Find the year amenities were built


Things to note:
- Prior to March 2012, data is based on date of approval for the resale transactions.
- For March 2012 onwards, the data is based on date of registration for the resale transactions.
