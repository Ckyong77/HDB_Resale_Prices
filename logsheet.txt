Cleaning
_____________
- real_Price: Real resale price that is adjusted for inflation using Singapore's monthly CPI of housing and utilities that were referenced to 2019. Formula is (resale_price / CPI) * 100. 
- remaining_lease was only available for 2016 onwards. 2016 remaining_lease were integers while 2017 onwards were in strings with years and months. Converted 2017 onwards to float years 
- flat_model is cleaned for duplicate classes, but should be further categorized/grouped to reduce number of classes.

Augmenting
_____________
- downloaded school, supermarket, hawkers, mrt, shopping malls, parks names/streets and got their coordinates. This was done through OneMap.sg. MRTs already has its coordinates from a link
- parks and supermarkets do not have names as parks data did not come with them, while for supermarkets, postal code was used
- computed distance to nearest amenities for each of the amenity
- computed number of each amenities within a 2km radius
- computed distance from Dhoby Ghaut MRT as it is one of the station with the most lines 

Plots
_____________
- median was chosen to avoid outliers
- lollipop charts compared 1997 and 2019 as 1997 was year of Asian Financial Crisis and 2019 was the latest year as 2020 did not have complete year and is affected by covid
- lollipop charts also compared 2015 and 2019 as 2015 was around the year after cooling measures so there was a dip in prices. CHANGE TO 2014 INSTEAD!!!
- lollipop charts also looked at all room types and 4-room separately as 4-rooms has the highest frequency of resales
- ridge plot used only 3-room : executive as the other types of rooms (1,2-room,multigeneration) had very little cases in 2017:2019. This period was chosen as it is the past few years
- bubble chart for storeys: also looked at 2017:2019 to check if years make a difference
- Block number: 3 digit system was introduced in the 1970s, with the 1st digit representing a neighbourhood in a town. So for e.g., AMK neighbourhood 1 starts with 101, 
and AMK neighbourhood 2 starts with 201. So first digit was separated from last 2 digits and plotted separately
- Flat model plots are available in both violin and ridgeline plots. Ridgeline plot takes very long to load and the effect is less obvious
- Lease commencement date plots are available in both boxplot and ridgeline plots. Again, ridgeline plot's effect is less obvious
- For distance to amenities, some of Kallang/Whampoa do not have the distance, which might be due to OneMap.sg.not being able to locate the place due to the two names in the search 
- For distance to amenities all year plot, there were some outliers that are more than 3km from nearest ameneties and they might have pulled the regression line, so they were removed.



TO DO
____________
- Check for duplicates
- Reduce number of classes in flat model
- Find the year amenities were built


Things to note:
- Prior to March 2012, data is based on date of approval for the resale transactions.
- For March 2012 onwards, the data is based on date of registration for the resale transactions.
